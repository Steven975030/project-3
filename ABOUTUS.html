            Our journey in the world of fashion began with a long-time dream to bring fashion to life.
            The inspiration for our enterprise comes from Mother Hannah's husband, who was a talented tailor.
            Now, that dream has come to life, and we are dedicated to pursuing our passion for fashion.
